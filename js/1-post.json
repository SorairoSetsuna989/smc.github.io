    ["p","Sometimes, the most unexpected events lead us to the best moment of our lives. In 2017, my parents both got transferred job assignments from Cavite to Quezon City. We were left with no choice but to transfer residences, so I had to transfer schools too. As someone who grew up in the province, I was sheltered and I was really unsure of how I could deal with living in the city. Could I really endure my stay here? Luckily, we discovered Stella Maris College, and I instantly felt like you were home SMC."],

And because of that, we should respect everyone and be kind to one another. If we are fortunate enough to have access to necessities such as food, water, and shelter- we should open our doors to our brothers and sisters who are in need."],
